# ✨ Mystic Enchantress Matchmaker Algorithm  
### A Forensic Psychology + Magical Compatibility Engine  
By **Araceli Garcia (Celibelle)**

---

## 🌙 Overview

This project is the **skeleton** of the Mystic Enchantress Matchmaker Algorithm, a system that blends:

- Forensic psychology  
- Attachment theory  
- MBTI cognitive function compatibility  
- Enneagram motivational mapping  
- Big Five trait distance modeling  
- Communication & conflict styles  
- Values & lifestyle alignment  
- Love languages  
- Long-term goal harmony  
- Magical energetic pairing  

This foundation will later be filled with real scoring logic based on Araceli's completed Forensic Psychology Workbook.

## 🧠 Scientific Weighting

The algorithm uses research-backed weighting:

- Big Five (OCEAN) – 20%
- MBTI Cognitive Compatibility – 10%
- Enneagram – 10%
- Tritype – 10%
- Attachment Style – 15%
- Communication Style – 10%
- Conflict Style – 5%
- Love Languages – 10%
- Values Alignment – 10%
- Lifestyle & Routine – 5%
- Goals & Future Vision – 5%
